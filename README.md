# IAS Project 4 - Reinforcement Learning
Link to GitHub repo: https://github.com/dcmid/IAS_P4_Reinforcement_Learning

This repository includes package support and demo file 
for each of the 3 challenges in this project. Challenges 
1 and 2 use the maze_rl package.

The demos can be executed directly from the root directory.

## 1. Value Iteration
To execute demo:
```
python value_iter_demo.py <policy output file>
```
If no file is specified, the policy is not saved.

One example output policy from running value iteration 
can be found in the file *policy.npy* in the root directory.

## 2. Q-Learning
To execute demo:
```
python qlearn_demo.py
```

## 3. Continuous State Space
